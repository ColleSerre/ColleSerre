# Hey there, I'm Daren Palmer and this is my todo list (I know it's huge)! 

HIGH PRIORITY:

* News API powered app iOS (ended up being flutter because fuck swift) 
* Spotify API powered flutter app so I can use the bloody swipe to queue on my oneplus (seriously spotify why am I the one doing this ???)

STANDARD PRIORITY:

1. API that allows you to find out what apps
/social media know about you (possible integration in-app) => became PrivacyApp ("https://www.my-privacy.online"); add colours to differentiate services on result screen (put highest ranking in green, lowest in red and leave the rest in blue)

2. Investigate a site that could remove you from all social media (possible improvement for PrivacyApp) => not feasible as people wouldn't give their social media creds / register all delete account pages

3. Investigate a script to automate bear exports and git commits/pulls

4. Write a battery level app using ubersicht and Web Bluetooth for macOS (not possible using Web Bluetooth as earphones aren't BLE) 

5. "message in a bottle" for Twitter => done but not published

6. Buy NFC tag and store resume/blog/portfolio on it 

7. "no one/someone with a bangle js has been here" app for my watch

8. An app that locates nearby thrift shops

9. DIY Google pay client for my watch?

10. Write a local website using the archillect API and the useless monitor

11. Scrape videos of art to display on the useless monitor.

12. A search bar on the desktop to play music on Spotify // more time needed

13. Waterproof karaoke screen for the shower

14. A screen that displays info on my bedroom window

15. a web interface for Pass CLI

16. Reminder app for Instagram 

17. Generating synthwave music using markov chain analysis

18. Image enhancer with ML

19. App pour localiser les associations 

20. A website that can use Instagram's API to graph out every mutual friendship (not really possible since Instagram's API requires auth to access user's subs)

20. Site qui joue une musique à une heure précise (pour le nouvel an)

21. An NFC/RFID jukebox . You choose your music by taping a device on the box.

22. Bot Twitter qui vérifie les infos (recherches à faire sur les méthodes utilisées par les journalistes)

23. Program that can determine formulas based on output and parameters using ai

# Software ideas

HIGH PRIORITY:

* Make a clubhouse clone with limited time (pitch: If you had 12 minutes to talk with a random person, what would you say ?). Gazeless would be a cool name? 

STANDARD PRIORITY:

1. API that allows you to find out what apps
/social media know about you (possible integration in-app) → became PrivacyApp (https://www.my-privacy.online); add colours to differentiate services on result screen (put the highest ranking in green, lowest in red and leave the rest in blue) ✅

2. Investigate a site that could remove you from all social media (possible improvement for PrivacyApp) => not feasible as people wouldn't give their social media creds / register all delete account pages ❌

3. Investigate a script to automate bear exports and git commits/pulls

4. Write a battery level app using ubersicht and Web Bluetooth for macOS (not possible using Web Bluetooth as earphones aren't BLE) 

5. message in a bottle for Twitter => done but not published ✅

6. Buy NFC tag and store resume/blog/portfolio on it ✅

7. no one/someone with a bangle js has been here app for my watch

8. An app that locates nearby thrift shops (will get popular with tiktok white girls)

9. DIY Google pay client for my watch? (forwarding transactions to another entity then automating another bank account, it's a hassle?) [NOT POSSIBLE] (https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-create-an-NFC-pay-tag-with-my-credit-card-details) ❌

10. Write a local website using the archillect API and the useless monitor ✅

11. Scrape videos of art to display on the useless monitor. ✅

12. A search bar for desktop to play music on Spotify // more time needed

13. Waterproof karaoke screen for my shower

14. A screen that displays info on my bedroom window

15. Reminder bot for Instagram 

16. Generating synthwave music using markov chain analysis

17. Image enhancer with ML

18. A website that can use Instagram's API to graph out every mutual friendship (not really possible since Instagram's API requires auth to access user's subs) ❌

19. Site qui joue une musique à une heure précise (pour le nouvel an)

20. An NFC/RFID jukebox . You choose your music by taping a device on the box.

21. Bot Twitter qui vérifie les infos (recherches à faire sur les méthodes utilisées par les journalistes). Je pense pas être à la hauteur de la responsabilité ❌

22. Program that can determine formulas based on output and parameters using ai

23. Create a program to sync my github description and google keep note. (done and automated using Apple Automator and a calendar event) ✅

24. Develop a service that you can integrate to websites to mine crypto off clients (piracy/is this even legal?). The users would be fully aware of this and it would replace ads. Give a share to website and a share to the user. After some market research, this already exists (what innovations are possible?)

25. Investigate hill climbing algorithms

26. Spotify API powered flutter app, so I can use the bloody swipe to queue on my OnePlus (seriously Spotify why am I the one doing this ???)

27. Create a variation of Conway's game of life that uses Reinforcement learning

28. Create an algorithm that creates art based on numbers and iterations

30. Solve the convex hull problem

31. Create my very own personal assistant that listens constantly for commands

32. Rewrite note syncing script on raspberry pi and automate syncing to github ✅

33. Make a physical switch for my smart bulbs

34. Build a key press recognition algorithm using computer vision to make my keyboard wireless (let’s learn opencv)

35. Build a Google Keep JS API

36. Learn OSINT

37. Learn how to test widgets programmatically in Flutter

38. An app that would let you swipe on emails like tinder (to avoid email bloat)

39. Use a text summarizing algorithm to create an app that presents easily readable versions of plato.stanford.edu

40. Reverse engineer the Xiaomi home app to use the private API (use home assistant?) 

41. News API powered app iOS (ended up being flutter because fuck swift ; basically done, moving onto something more interesting now)  ✅

42. Setup airplay for my google home using AirConnect

43. Fake news detector python

44. Chrome extension that graphs your focus on a tab (anti procrastination)
